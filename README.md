# Open Event

Let's create open events for only public benefits.

## Philosophy

The world is a better place when we come together and share our knowledge, ideas, thoughts, and experiences. Open Event is a platform to create and share events for the benefit of the public. There are no restrictions on the type of events that can be created. It could be a conference, a meetup, a hackathon, a workshop, or any other type of event. The only requirement is that the event should be open and accessible to the public.

## Why Open Event?

There are many platforms to create events. They are either too expensive, too complicated, or too restrictive. Open Event is a free, easy to use, and open platform to create any type of event. It is a place where you can create your event and share it with the world.

## How to use Open Event?

Open Event is a web application. You can use it by creating an account and hosting your events. The platform is free for everyone to use. You can create as many events as you want. The events are open to the public and can be viewed by anyone. The events are also open for everyone to modify and improve.

Login with crypto wallet so we can gift you a badge NFT. That will be your badge for events. You can also create your own badge NFT and use it for events. That badge will let you get access to the event. Event organizers can check your badge NFT and let you in.

While you're attending the events, the NFT will list your name and the event you're attending. That will be your proof of attendance. You can also use the NFT to prove your attendance to your employer.
